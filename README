I wrote a small iPhone app a little while ago called FireWater, for which I developed a simple pressure-based fluid simulation.

I thought it would be fun to port it to the HTML5 Canvas in Javascript to learn the Canvas myself and teach a little about writing simulations.
That's jsWater.

If your browser supports HTML5 canvas, but the canvas above is not filled with black, please refresh your browser.

Once you have a black canvas, click and drag on it to see it in action.
