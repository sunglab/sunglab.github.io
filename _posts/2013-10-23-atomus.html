<h4>
    Atomus is a kinetic interactive visualizer but also it is a work of art.
    <br>
    Atomus was designed for helping people who want to think more creatively or who need a change of pace.
    However, I believe it could be a game/ toy/ party material/ interior design element for anyone who ever loved fireworks, whirlwinds, firefly lights, aurora, rainbow, wave, mobius strip, heart or atomic symbol. I have put something in the app which remind you of those and more , but it's intensely dynamic and also you are able to control all of those.
    <br>
    Technically, Atomus was made with mathematics, physics and 3D graphic technics.
    Its rendering system was enough optimized using neon assembly codes for mobile computing environments.
    Consequently, Atomus guarantees 60 FPS speed on any platforms.</h4>
